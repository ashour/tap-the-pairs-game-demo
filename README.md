# Tap the Pairs Game Demo
Tap the Pairs is a word-matching game designed to help you learn a new language. It's inspired by [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/)'s “Tap the pairs” minigame.

This game was made as a demo for a
[PhraseApp Blog article](https://phraseapp.com/blog/posts/lets-build-localize-mini-game/).
It was made with [React](https://reactjs.org/).

See it running live [on Heroku](https://tap-pairs-game-demo.herokuapp.com/).
